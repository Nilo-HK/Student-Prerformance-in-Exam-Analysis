# Student-Prerformance-in-Exam-Analysis


For this project, my objective was to uncover the factors that drive student motivation to study. I took advantage of various graphs and R programming language to analyze variables, employing tools like plots, barplots, ggplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, and more. Additionally, I employed six models to anticipate the impact of different variables on students' studying habits.
