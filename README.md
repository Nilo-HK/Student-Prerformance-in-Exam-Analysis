# Student-Prerformance-in-Exam-Analysis


In this project, my goal was to find factors that motivate students to study. I took advantage of different graphs and codes to analyze variables, including plots, barplots, ggplots, scatterplot, heatmap, and so on. Also, I anticipated six models to see what variables have more effects on studying for students.
